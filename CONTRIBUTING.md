## Contributing

Contributions are accepted as Pull Requests (PR) on GitHub.
Kindly adhere to these basic guidelines to contribute:

- A PR should have a clear purpose and do one thing only, and nothing more.
  This will enable us to review your PR more quickly.

- Each commit in PR should be a small, atomic change, representing one step in development.

- Please squash intermediate steps within PR for bug fixes, style cleanups, reversions, etc. in order to prevent them from showing up in the merged PR history.

- If something isn't clear from the code, please clarify it in the comments, commit messages, or PR description, as applicable.
